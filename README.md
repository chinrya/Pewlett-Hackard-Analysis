# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to introduce us to SQL and PGAdmin, and to practice the basics, such as selecting specific data, merging dataframes, and saving new tables as CSV files. 

# Results 

One major point from the resulting data tables are they over 70,000 employees will be retiring soon, so a significant hiring spree will be necessary in order to maintain current numbers within Pewlett Hackard. Another point from the first deliverable is that very few managers are retiring, and it's instead primarily senior staff who are retiring soon, so promotions for current employees to be moved up to senior positions is advised. As for the second deliverable, from what I was able to see from the data tables, there aren't enough current employees who would be able to mentor the new wave. Perhaps changing the mentorship rules to expand the amount of mentors availible will be benificial in adqeuately training newer staff to fill the upcoming vaccuum. 

# Summary

To answer the first question, there are 72,458 employees who will be retiring soon. In my opinion, in response to the second question, I do not believe the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program is adequate to meet demands of roughly 70,000 employees being trained into their respective roles.
